		<h1>Present-tense. An unlikely Buddhist <br> Meditation on Death & Masculinity</h1>
		<img src="image/top/background.png">
		<p class="font-charmonman">My Mother is dying, present-tense. Her time here on this planet will soon close. I
			have many thoughts— as a
			son,
			a buddhist and a man. If only to assuage my feelings of grief a bit and to avoid relying too much on others,
			I
			have been writing them down, since June. As a practicing (non) buddhist, I rely on one central
			teaching — the
			First Noble Truth, which says that desire — specifically for things to be different, is the cause of all
			suffering. Indeed, Gautama the Buddha’s own awakening began with the realization that there is no avoiding
			sickness, old age and death. All of us falter in our acceptance of this truth at one time or another.</p>
		<p class="font-indie-flower">On Memorial Day weekend, my mother choked on hot-dog, and her heart stopped. I find
			it painfully ironic that
			the
			last solid food my American-Italian Mother ate was a hot-dog. My father could not resuscitate her and she
			slipped into a coma. I didn’t know about the incident until the next day when my brother called. We already
			knew
			that she was suffering from dementia or something akin to it — hence the swallowing issues. When she came
			out of
			the coma, she received another diagnosis — stomach cancer. I went to the bed, for about three days. Not a
			very
			manly thing to do. My brother would call and tell me what was going on, but most people I spoke with didn’t
			really know what to say — if anything at all. I reached out to a few people at the time, most of whom were
			sympathetic, but for the first time I noticed very few people know how to deal with sickness or death, or
			can
			appreciate another person’s experience of them. There was awkwardness around my grief, my tearfulness,
			weakness
			and vulnerability.</p>
		<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgba(0,0,0,.84);padding-left: 20px; ">
			<strong class="line-height">Lesson: Death cannot be made “pretty” or sterilized or gentle. It is reasonable
				to expect the
				absolute
				utter worst during a time of death. Even a person with training in meditation can make errors and fall
				prey
				to illusion, expectations and the like. Do not beat yourself up about it.</strong>
